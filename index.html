                <p>Indonesia, officially the Republic of Indonesia, is a country in Southeast Asia that consists of over 17,000 islands, including Sumatra, Java, Sulawesi, and parts of Borneo and New Guinea. 
                Indonesia is the world's largest island country, the largest archipelagic country, and the 14th-largest country by area, at 1,904,569 square kilometres (735,358 square miles).</p>
                
                <p>Indonesia consists of thousands of distinct native ethnic and hundreds of linguistic groups, with Javanese being the largest. A shared identity has developed with the motto "Bhinneka Tunggal Ika" ("Unity in Diversity" literally, "many, yet one").</p>

                    <li class="facts-header center">The world's biggest flower lives in Indonesia</li>
                    <p class="facts-paragraph">The Rafflessia Arnoldia, also known as the "corpse lily", due to its foul odour upon blooming, is the largest flower in the world. These huge flowers mostly grow in Indonesia's rainforests, are very tricky to find and after months of the bud developing, 
                    only last a short few days. The orangey, red, parasitic, 
                    five-petalled flower has no observable stem or leaves, can grow up to 3 feet and can weigh a hefty ten kilograms. </p>

                    <li class="facts-header center">Home to over 700 different languages and dialects</li>
                    <p class="facts-paragraph">This shocking number of languages is spoken throughout the Indonesian archipelago, with Bahasa Indonesia being the official language of Indonesia. Just the Papua Province alone, boasts over 270 spoken dialets. 
                    The total population for Indonesia is around 242 million people and Indonesia is also the largest Muslim-majority nation in the world.</p>

                    <li class="facts-header center">It's also home to the largest volcanic lake on earth</li>
                    <p class="facts-paragraph">Lake Toba is the world’s biggest natural, volcanic lake and is located inside a super-volcano in northern Sumatra in Indonesia. The lake is simply enormous and has been measured to be roughly 500 metres deep, 100 kilometres long and 30 kilometres wide. 
                    Lake Toba is thought to be the site of a monster eruption that occurred around 70,000 years ago and is thought to be the largest-known explosive eruption on earth and killed the majority of humans alive at that time.</p>

            <article>
                <p>The first Europeans arrived in the archipelago in 1512, when Portuguese traders, led by Francisco Serrão, sought to monopolise the sources of nutmeg, cloves, and cubeb pepper in the Maluku Islands. Dutch and British traders followed. 
                In 1602, the Dutch established the Dutch East India Company (<span class="bold">VOC</span>) and became the dominant European power for almost 200 years. The <span class="bold">VOC</span> was dissolved in 1800 following bankruptcy, and the Netherlands established the Dutch East Indies as a nationalised colony.</p>
                    
                <p>For most of the colonial period, Dutch control over the archipelago was tenuous. Dutch forces were engaged continuously in quelling rebellions both on and off Java. The influence of local leaders such as Prince Diponegoro in central Java, Imam Bonjol in central Sumatra, Pattimura in Maluku, 
                and the bloody 30-year war in Aceh weakened the Dutch and tied up the colonial military forces. Only in the early 20th century did Dutch dominance extend to what was to become Indonesia's current boundaries</p>

                <p>The Japanese invasion and subsequent occupation during World War II ended Dutch rule and encouraged the previously suppressed independence movement. Two days after the surrender of Japan in August 1945, 
                <span class="underline">Soekarno</span> and <span class="underline">Mohammad Hatta</span>, influential nationalist leaders, proclaimed Indonesian independence and were appointed president and vice-president, respectively</p>
            
                <p>The Netherlands attempted to re-establish their rule, and a bitter armed and diplomatic struggle ended in December 1949 when the Dutch formally recognised Indonesian independence in the face of international pressure and transferred sovereignty to the United States of Indonesia.
                Despite extraordinary political, social and sectarian divisions, Indonesians, on the whole, found unity in their fight for independence.</p>
